The narration and noun list mention a \\\"pit\\\", so `pit15` matches that description. Although the event records the drop location as `counter.007` rather than a specific food waste bin, the action still involves the pit itself, making `pit15` the relevant object. No other objects appear in the event history or match the nouns in this timeframe, so only `pit15` is listed as used.\"}"}
