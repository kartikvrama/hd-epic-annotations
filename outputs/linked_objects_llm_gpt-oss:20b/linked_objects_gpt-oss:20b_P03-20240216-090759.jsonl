The event history shows that the `food waste bin` was picked up from the cupboard at 01:46, before the action window (01:48-01:49), implying it was already in hand during the lift. No separate lid object appears in the available objects list, and no other object is moved during the action. Therefore, the `food waste bin` is the relevant object used in the action."}

Within the action window (01:49-01:50), the event history records the bag being picked from the cupboard at 01:50 and the bin being dropped back to the cupboard at the same time. These events fall inside the action timeframe, indicating that both objects are actively manipulated during the action. Thus both the bag and the bin are considered used objects."}

In the event history, the only event involving the cupboard is at 01:50 when a food waste bin was dropped into `cupboard.003`, which is outside the action window. No pick or drop event for a cupboard or its door occurs during the action, and none of the available objects match the noun \"cupboard\" (the closest is \"blue cupboard tray 1\", which is a tray, not a cupboard). Therefore no objects from the available list are used in this action."}

The event at 02:03 involves a `dish washer brush`, outside the action interval, and the noun \"coffee grounds\" refers to material on the filter rather than a distinct object in the list.
