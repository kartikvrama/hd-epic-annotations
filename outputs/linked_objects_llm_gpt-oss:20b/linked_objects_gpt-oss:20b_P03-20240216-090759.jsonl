The narration states the user is 'picking up' a recipe card from the table, which matches this event. The `Track 71 (skipped)` object is dropped to the table at the same time but is not picked up, so it is not considered used in the described action. No other available objects appear in the event history within the time frame, so `Track 73 (skipped)` is the sole relevant object.\"}"}
