The narration describes tossing food residue directly from the kitchen top into the sink, but none of the listed objects (such as a spoon, plate, or sink strainer) appear in the event history during that time, and no other object is explicitly mentioned.

No pick or drop events for this object occur within the action timeframe, but its presence in the available objects and its explicit mention in the narration make it the only object that is actively used during the action."}

The noun list explicitly names \"orange cloth\" and \"cloth\", and the available objects list contains an object called \"orange cloth\". No pick or drop events occur between 14:15 and 14:25, so the only relevant object inferred from the narration and object availability is the orange cloth itself."}

None of the other objects (e.g., \"orange cloth\") are shown being picked or dropped in the event history. Therefore, no objects from the available list are confirmed as used in this action."}

Among the available objects, the only items that match the noun \"cloth\" and could reasonably be placed on the sink are the towel-type objects. \"Tea towel2\" is the most plausible candidate, as it is a cloth that can be laid on a sink surface. No pick/drop events occur during the action window, so the identification relies solely on the narration and noun list."}

No cupboard object appears in the available objects list, and the nouns \"cupboard\" and \"sink\" are not represented as items.

The only event that occurs during the action window (14:31-14:32) is the pick-up of the object named `cleaner` from `cupboard.002` at 14:32, which matches the noun in the narration and is included in the available objects list. No other objects are mentioned or have relevant pick/drop events within the timeframe, so `cleaner` is the sole object used in this action."}

The only event during the action start time is the picker of a cleaner from the cupboard, which is unrelated to the closing action.

In the event history, the object `cleaner` is picked up at 14:32 (just before the action starts) and dropped at 14:43 (just after it ends), indicating that it was in use throughout the 14:33-14:42 interval. No other available objects appear in the event log during this time, and the nouns in the narration (cleaning product, bottle, lever) map directly to the `cleaner` item. Therefore, `cleaner` is the sole object used in this action."}

The narration refers to closing a cupboard under the sink, but there is no object named \"cupboard\" or \"sink\" in the available list. Thus the only available object implicated by both the narration (cupboard location) and the event timeline is the `cleaner`."}

This indicates the cupboard was opened and the cleaner was moved as part of that action.

The available objects list contains a `cleaner`, so this object is the only one relevant to the action. No other objects mentioned in the narration appear in the event history during the action window, and the nouns such as \"top shelf\" and \"sink\" refer to locations rather than objects, so they are not added to the used list."}

Moreover, the event history shows only a `cleaner` dropped to the cupboard at 14:43 and an `orange cloth` dropped to the sink at 15:10, both outside the 14:55-14:57 window and involving unrelated items.

The narration describes picking up the cloth that fell on the sink, so the orange cloth is the relevant object. No other available object is mentioned in the narration or involved in any event during this time, and the tap, though mentioned, has no corresponding event or object in the available list."}

The narration describes rinsing and squeezing a cloth, so that cloth must be the one being used. No other cloth objects (tea towels, white cloth, etc.) have any pick or drop events in the timeline, and the water itself is not listed as an object in the scene, so only `orange cloth` is considered relevant."}

The narration refers to wiping the sink with the orange cloth, making it the relevant object. No other objects from the available list are mentioned in the narration or event history during this time, and the tap water is not represented as a distinct object in the available list.
