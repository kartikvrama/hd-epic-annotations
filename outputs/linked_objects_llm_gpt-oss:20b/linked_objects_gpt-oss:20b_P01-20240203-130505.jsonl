The narration refers to retrieving a new packet of butter from the fridge, and `Track 11` is the only object in the available list that is both picked during the action window and plausibly corresponds to that packet (the other butter-related items are not mentioned in the event history).

In the event history at 10:43, the `wooden spatula` is dropped to `hob.001`, which is the same location where the `pot` was dropped at 10:42.

While the narration references a plate as the location from which the spatula is taken, no pick or drop event involves a plate object during this time; the plate is only mentioned as a noun, not as an object moved or interacted with. Therefore, the `wooden spatula` is the sole object used in the described action."}
{"trace_id": "P01-20240203-130505-359", "action_narration": "Again, mix the content of the pot, turning the carrots and the onions around the pan, especially the ones at the bottom, get them to the top by turning things around, holding the handle of the pot with the left hand.", "nouns": ["content of pot", "carrots", "onions", "pan", "especially ones", "bottom", "things", "handle of pot"], "objects_used": [], "explanation": "There are no pick or drop events that occur between 13:37 and 13:43 involving any of the nouns mentioned (pot, carrots, onions, pan, handle of pot). The only event recorded is a wooden spatula being picked at 13:36 and dropped at 13:46, both outside the action window. Therefore, no objects from the available list can be confidently linked to the described action."}
{"trace_id": "P01-20240203-130505-360", "action_narration": "Hit the spatula against the rim of the pot to drop any onion that has stuck to it.", "nouns": ["spatula", "rim of pot", "any onion", "pot"], "objects_used": ["wooden spatula"], "explanation": "The action describes using a spatula to hit the rim of a pot. In the event history, the only object that overlaps with the action period (13:43-13:45) and matches a noun in the narration is the `wooden spatula`, which was picked up at 13:36 and remains in hand during the action. No pick or drop events for the `pot` or `onion` are recorded within the action interval, so those objects are not considered used in this specific action."}

The narration explicitly states that the spatula is placed on the plate, so the spatula is the object that is actually handled. No event shows the plate being moved or interacted with in any pick or drop action, so the plate itself is not considered a used object in this context. Therefore, only `wooden spatula` is identified as used."}
