No other objects in the available list are referenced in the narration or event history during this period, so only the plastic black spoon is considered used."}

In the event history during the action interval (29:32-29:33), the only spoon that is dropped into the sink is `plastic black spoon`. No other spoon appears in the events or is moved during this timeframe, so `plastic black spoon` is the relevant object used."}

No events involve the towel itself, the frying pan, or any other object in the narration, so only the holder is considered used in this action."}

The sole event during the action shows `kitchen towel3` being dropped to the bin, which involves the towel but not a lid.
