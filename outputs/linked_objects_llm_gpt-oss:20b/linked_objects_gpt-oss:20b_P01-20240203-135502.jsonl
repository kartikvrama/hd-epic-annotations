The event history records that the \"biscuit packet\" was picked up from counter.008 at 09:57, just before the action's start time of 09:58, indicating that this object is the one being handled. No other objects from the list are mentioned in the narration or appear in pick/drop events during the action window, so only \"biscuit packet\" is deemed relevant."}

No other plastic-related items (e.g., \"plastic lid\", \"plastic part\") are referenced in the event history, and the large bowl picked at 09:59 is not a packaging item.

The narration refers to a \"white bowl\" on the countertop being moved to the left, and the only bowl listed in the available objects that appears in the event history is the large bowl.

In the event history, at 10:02 (within the 10:01-10:02 action window) the `biscuit packet` is dropped onto `shelf.005`. A biscuit packet is a typical example of plastic packaging, and no other plastic-related object is dropped in this window.

In the event history, the \"box of foil\" is the only object that is interacted with (picked up at 10:14 and again at 10:17) during the time window. No separate cover object is listed in the available objects, and the noun \"box of foil cover\" does not correspond to any distinct object in the list.

No event records a move of the plain \"box\" (the empty box) or of any roll-of-foil object, so the other nouns cannot be confirmed as used within the action.

None of the other nouns-smaller chopping board, strainer, ladle-appear in the event history, nor are they explicitly present in the available objects list (the list contains a generic `chopping board` but no distinct smaller board). Thus the only object that can be confidently said to be used in this action is the `large chopping board`. The narration mentions the pile and the other items, but without pick/drop evidence we cannot include them as used objects.

This action implies the drawer is being interacted with (opened to receive the object and then closed), aligning with the narration \"Close the drawer.\" No other available objects are moved or referenced within the action timeframe, and the drawer itself is not listed among the available objects, so `Track 99 (skipped)` is the sole relevant object."}

No pick or drop events for any pot occur during or overlapping the action timeframe, so the pot is not considered actively used in the action even though it is mentioned in the narration.

The narration explicitly instructs to pick up the spatula, and the only available object that matches the noun 'spatula' is the same `spatula`. No other object in the available list is referenced in a pick or drop event during this time, and while a plate is mentioned as a location reference, it is not moved, so it is not considered used in the action."}

No pot object appears in the event history during this interval, so only the `pan lid` can be confidently identified as used.

The only event recorded is a pan lid being picked at 11:07 (before the action) and dropped at 11:18 (after the action). Because there is no evidence of any spoon, ladle, pot, or bowl being handled during the time the narrator describes stirring, none of the objects from the available list can be confirmed as used in this action."}

No other pick or drop events involving oil containers occur during the action, and the nouns list contains only the generic term \"oil\".
