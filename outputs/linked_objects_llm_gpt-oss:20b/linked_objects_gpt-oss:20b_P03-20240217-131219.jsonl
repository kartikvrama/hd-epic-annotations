The narration refers to picking up another chunk of squash, which corresponds to this piece. No other objects from the available list have pick or drop events that overlap the 12:58-12:59 window, and the chopping board is mentioned only as the source location, not as an object that was moved.

The bowl is explicitly mentioned in the narration and the available list contains a `large bowl` that would logically receive the squash, so it is considered used even though the drop event occurs after the action window.

This is the only bag-type object that appears in the event history and therefore is the one actually used in the described action.

The `big knife` drop at 23:08 is outside the action window, and no other objects from the available list are referenced in the event history.

This indicates the user moved the scale into the bottom cupboard before or while closing it with their right hand.

No other objects from the available list are mentioned in the narration, and the outer part of the colander was dropped to the counter at 39:15, which does not align with the described task of scrubbing the inside part.

In the event history, the only event that occurs during the 41:12-41:14 window is the drop of `large glass lid` to `hob.001` (the location of the pan).

In the event history, at 41:23 the `right fork` is picked from `table.002` and the `red plate` is also picked from the same location, both within the action window.

The event history shows the left fork being picked up at 41:24, matching this action. The fork is on the red plate, which was previously picked from the table at 41:23, so the plate is also part of the scene during the action. The dishwasher appears only as a destination and is involved in a drop event that occurs after the action's end time, so it is not considered used for this action."}

No other objects are picked or dropped in that interval, and `cup` is the sole noun from the narration that is also present in the available objects list.

The narration specifies placing a cup upside-down on the dishwasher top rack next to another cup of the same color, but the available object list only contains one `cup` and no second cup.

Neither of these objects is referenced in the narration or the list of nouns. The narration concerns moving the dishwasher top rack, but no object named 'dishwasher top rack' (or a close synonym) is present in the available objects list.

The only event recorded in that interval is the small knife being dropped into the dishwasher at 41:43, which occurs before the action begins. Additionally, the available objects list does not contain an explicit 'dishwasher bottom rack' or a generic 'dishwasher' object, so there is no noun from the narration that matches an object present in the scene.

The narration refers to a frying pan on the hob and a ladle being held, matching the two objects present in the available list.
