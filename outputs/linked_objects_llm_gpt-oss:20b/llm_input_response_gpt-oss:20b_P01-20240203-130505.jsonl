The narration explicitly states that the spatula is placed on the plate, so the spatula is the object that is actually handled. No event shows the plate being moved or interacted with in any pick or drop action, so the plate itself is not considered a used object in this context. Therefore, only `wooden spatula` is identified as used.\"}"}
