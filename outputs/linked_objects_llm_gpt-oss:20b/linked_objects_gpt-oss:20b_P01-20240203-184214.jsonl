Additionally, a sponge is dropped onto counter.005 at 18:42, within the action interval, which is typical for rinsing; this event overlap confirms that the sponge is used during the action.

In the event history the `yogurt tub` is dropped onto the counter at the start time of the action, indicating it is the source of the yogurt. The spoon that is shaken is identified in the available objects as `spoon6`, which is dropped to the sink just after the action end time, showing it was manipulated during the action.

The narration also specifies that the spoon should be placed on top of the strainer, and the object `strainer` is listed among the available objects, indicating it is the receptacle used in the action.  No other pick or drop events involve the strainer, but its presence in the available list and its explicit mention in the narration make it a relevant object in this action."}
