No other object in the available list is involved in a pick or drop during this interval, and the other events (dropping the bottle of liquid hand wash and dropping the pan) occur at the same time but do not correspond to the action of picking up the spatula.

The event history does not capture any pick/drop during the 00:19-00:21 interval, so we infer that the hand-wash bottle was used.

The narration explicitly states that the cloth is used to scrub water from the bowl, confirming its involvement. The bowl is also part of the action - the narrator is holding a 'washed bowl' with the left hand and scrubbing it. Among the available objects, the most appropriate match for a washed bowl is the 'white serving bowl'. Although no pick/drop event is recorded for this bowl, its presence is inferred from the description of the action, making it a relevant object used in the task."}

The available objects list contains no 'exhaust fan', 'button', or similar item, and the only events in the specified window are none - the yogurt container was dropped at 07:35 and the plate was picked at 07:41, both outside the action interval.

The transfer between hands occurs during the 07:49-07:50 interval, making `plate2` the relevant object.

The pick of the `green pot` at 07:59 occurs at the very end of the time window but is not mentioned in the narration or nouns, and the earlier `plate2` drop at 07:53 occurs before the action starts.
