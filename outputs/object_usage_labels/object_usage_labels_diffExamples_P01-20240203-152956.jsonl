The high-level task for the entire interval is \\\"Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper\\\". This task explicitly requires plates as the surface on which pies are placed.\\n3. After the plate is put down, it remains on the counter and is never removed again during the period. The subsequent actions involve piling pies onto plates and wrapping them with foil, which means the plate is being used passively as a receptacle.\\n4. According to the definition, an object is considered 'being used' if it contributes to the high-level activity either by being held or by performing a function as part of that activity. The plate satisfies both conditions: it was held at the beginning and then served as the surface for the pies.\\n5.

After this point, the event log contains no further interactions with the fork.\\n2. Throughout the period 00:50-02:54, the high-level activity is \\\"Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper.\\\" The actions that actually manipulate the pies are performed with a plastic spoon (e.g., pick up pie2 at 01:29, pick up two pies at 01:30). No narration or atomic action mentions the fork being used to pick up, move, or otherwise interact with the pies or plates.\\n3. Since the fork is not held by the person after 00:50 and there is no evidence that it is passively contributing to the task (e.g., acting as a support or being used to hold something), it does not meet the criteria for being \\\"used\\\" during this period.\\n4.
