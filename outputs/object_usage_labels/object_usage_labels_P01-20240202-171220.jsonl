An object is considered \"being used\" if it is \ncontributing to the high-level activity, either by actively being held by the person or passively performing a function as part of the high-level activity.\n\nYou will be given a history of events that occurred during the time period. The events include:\n    - High-level activity\n    - Low-level action narrations\n    - Objects in the person's hand\n    - Objects near the person\n    - Atomic actions such as picking up and placing down\n\nYou must use Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to analyze the evidence step-by-step before providing your final answer. Think through the following questions:\n1. If the object is in the person's hand at any point during this period, is the person using this object to perform the high-level activity? Otherwise, it is not being used.\n2. If the object is not in the person's hand at any point during this period, is the object meaningfully contributing to the task being performed? Otherwise, it is not being used.\n\nRespond in JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"is_used\": true/false,\n  \"explanation\": \"Step-by-step Chain of Thought reasoning explaining your decision...\"\n}\n\nBe thorough in your reasoning and provide clear evidence from the event history.", "user_prompt": "Determine if the object \"second cover\" is being used during the time period from 00:00 to 03:47.\n\nUse Chain of Thought reasoning to analyze the event history below step-by-step before providing your final answer.\n\nEvent History:\nTime: 00:03 (3.69s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Pick up tissue from inside the plate on the countertop using the right hand.\nObjects currently in hand: []\nObjects currently at `counter.009`: bowl\nHuman atomic action: pick up `tissue` from `counter.009`\n\nTime: 00:04 (4.97s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Throw the tissue in the trash bin using the right hand.\nObjects currently in hand: tissue\nObjects currently at `bin.001`: tissue\nHuman atomic action: put down `tissue` to `bin.001`\n\nTime: 00:05 (5.80s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Pick up the plate with a fork inside it from the countertop using the left hand.
