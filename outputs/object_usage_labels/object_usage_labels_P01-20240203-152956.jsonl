Otherwise, it is not being used.\n\nRespond in JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"is_used\": true/false,\n  \"explanation\": \"Step-by-step Chain of Thought reasoning explaining your decision...\"\n}\n\nBe thorough in your reasoning and provide clear evidence from the event history.", "user_prompt": "Determine if the object \"foil wrap\" is being used during the time period from 02:18 to 02:23.\n\nUse Chain of Thought reasoning to analyze the event history below step-by-step before providing your final answer.\n\nEvent History:\nTime: 02:18 (138.45s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper\nObjects currently in hand: box of foil wrap\nObjects currently at `counter.008`: []\nHuman atomic action: pick up `foil wrap` from `counter.008`\n\nTime: 02:18 (138.91s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper\nCurrent scene narration:\n  - Pick up the foil wrap from the box, placing the box on the countertop.\nObjects currently in hand: foil wrap, box of foil wrap\nObjects currently at `counter.008`: box of foil wrap\nHuman atomic action: put down `box of foil wrap` to `counter.008`\n\nTime: 02:23 (143.40s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper\nCurrent scene narration:\n  - tear the unrolled foil by using both hands on the edge of the unrolled foil and tearing it apart.\nObjects currently in hand: foil wrap\nObjects currently at `mid-air`: []\nHuman atomic action: pick up `unrolled foil` from `mid-air`\n\nTime: 02:23 (143.61s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Pick up the second tray from the oven, pile the meat pies on two plate and cover one of them using foil paper\nCurrent scene narration:\n  - tear the unrolled foil by using both hands on the edge of the unrolled foil and tearing it apart.\nObjects currently in hand: foil wrap, unrolled foil\nObjects currently at `counter.008`: foil wrap, box of foil wrap\nHuman atomic action: put down `foil wrap` to `counter.008`\n\n\nProvide your analysis using Chain of Thought reasoning, then output your answer in the required JSON format.", "examples": [{"prompt": "Determine if the object \"pot\" is being used during the time period from 01:01 to 01:04.\n\nUse Chain of Thought reasoning to analyze the event history below step-by-step before providing your final answer.\n\nEvent History:\nTime: 01:01 (61.93s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nObjects currently in hand: []\nObjects currently at `hob.001`: []\nHuman atomic action: pick up `pot` from `hob.001`\n\nTime: 01:04 (64.52s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Put the pan with the strainer to the right of the sink.\nObjects currently in hand: pot\nObjects currently at `counter.006`: pot, strainer\nHuman atomic action: put down `pot` to `counter.006`\n\n\nProvide your analysis using Chain of Thought reasoning, then output your answer in the required JSON format.", "response": {"is_used": true, "explanation": "The object `pot` is moved from the hob to the counter while the person is clearing the dishes.
