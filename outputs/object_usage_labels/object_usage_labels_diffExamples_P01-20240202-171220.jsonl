Otherwise, it is not being used.\n    2. If the object is not in the person's hand during this period, is the object meaningfully contributing to the task being performed? Otherwise, it is not being used.\n\nRespond in JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  'is_used': true/false,\n  'explanation': 'Step-by-step Chain of Thought reasoning explaining your decision...'\n}\n\nBe thorough in your reasoning and provide clear evidence from the event history.", "user_prompt": "Determine if the object 'bag of bagels' is being used during the time period between 00:00 (0.00s) and 03:19 (199.70s).\n\nUse Chain of Thought reasoning to analyze the event history below step-by-step before providing your final answer.\n\nEvent History:\nTime: 00:03 (3.69s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Pick up tissue from inside the plate on the countertop using the right hand.\nObjects currently in hand: []\nObjects currently at `counter.009`: bowl\nHuman atomic action: pick up `tissue` from `counter.009`\n\nTime: 00:04 (4.97s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Throw the tissue in the trash bin using the right hand.\nObjects currently in hand: tissue\nObjects currently at `bin.001`: tissue\nHuman atomic action: put down `tissue` to `bin.001`\n\nTime: 00:05 (5.80s)\nHigh-level task being performed: Clear the dishes\nCurrent scene narration:\n  -  Pick up the plate with a fork inside it from the countertop using the left hand.
