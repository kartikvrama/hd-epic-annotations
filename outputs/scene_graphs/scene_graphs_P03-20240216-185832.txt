Event #952 | Time: 3964.33s (66:04) | PICK: pan
High-Level Activity: Stir eggs and add them to the pan [Recipe: R04]
Active Narrations:
  [3963.40s - 3976.44s] Slide the top part of the spatula underneath the edge of the Spanish omelette, resting the spatula on the inside of the pan, close to the frying pan brim, and move the spatula up and down while going around the frying pan. I do this to make sure the egg doesn't get stuck and doesn't burn, and also to check how well cooked the egg is so far.
