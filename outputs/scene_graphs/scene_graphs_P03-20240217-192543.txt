Event #122 | Time: 437.93s (07:17) | PICK: small frying pan
High-Level Activity: Cook and season aubergine [Recipe: R07]
Active Narrations:
  [437.78s - 443.47s] Stir the aubergine again in the frying pan, tilting the aubergine with the wooden spoon, so that the salt and the black pepper are mixed well with the aubergine. This time I do this more carefully, moving the spoon more slowly so that I don't spill the aubergine on the hob, as I did earlier.
