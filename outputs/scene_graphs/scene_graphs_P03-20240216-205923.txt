Event #243 | Time: 815.83s (13:35) | DROP: plastic box
High-Level Activity: Split pizza dough, stretch and fold each split and put dough in the fridge [Recipe: R05]
Active Narrations:
  [812.67s - 816.04s] Push the other pizza dough ball using the dough scraper so that it is closer to the corner of the plastic box and further away from the other pizza dough ball.
  [812.74s - 816.45s] Push the pizza dough with the dough scraper from right to left in the plastic box. I do this so that the two pizza dough balls are further from each other. This is the reason why I didn't put the plastic box in the fridge earlier, because at the moment the two pizza dough balls are too close to each other. Which is a problem because the dough will rise, so if the two balls are too close, they will get stuck to each other.
